How SiteSon Works

.htaccess - Handles clean URLs like /about, /contact, /products/tshirt.

index.php - Reads all page content, menus, and meta info directly from site.json.

admin/SiteSon/site.json - Stores your entire website: pages, templates, menus, SEO data, anything you want.

admin/SiteSon/index.php - Lets you easily edit and save everything inside the JSON without touching any code.

When a user visits your site, PHP simply loads site.json, finds the requested page, and displays it using your HTML structure and templates.

‚ö° Why It‚Äôs So Good

Editable: Built-in admin editor to manage all content easily.

SEO Ready: Page titles, meta descriptions, and social tags all managed in JSON.
